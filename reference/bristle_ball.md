# CleanChew Bristle — Playful Dental Care for Dogs

**Short tagline**
A durable, bristled chew toy that cleans teeth while your dog plays — gentle on gums, effective with regular use.

## Description

CleanChew Bristle is a textured, multi-surface dog toy engineered to remove plaque and massage gums during normal chewing and fetch. Its soft, angled bristles reach between teeth and along the gumline so playtime also becomes a simple dental-care routine.

## Key features

- **Multi-textured bristle matrix:** soft silicone bristles plus firmer ridges for scraping and polishing.
- **Dual-action surfaces:** cleaning bristles on one side, chew-safe ridges on the other.
- **Durable, non-toxic materials:** food-grade silicone + reinforced core for long life.
- **Floating, lightweight design** for fetch and water play.
- **Easy to clean:** dishwasher-safe or rinse-and-scrub for fast maintenance.
- **Multiple sizes and colors** to fit puppies through large breeds.

## Benefits

- Helps reduce plaque buildup and gently massage gums with regular use.
